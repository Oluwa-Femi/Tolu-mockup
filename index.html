                <h1 style="align-content: center;">Hi. I'm <strong>Tolu</strong>.</h1>
                <p><strong>
                    I am super cool. I also double as a web developer. I am pretty, intelligent and love taking on challenges.
                    I make it an habit to make my mum go solo to parties and leave me alone in the house, well coz I love my space duh!
                    I love her though. I have a very cute brother, I call him my firstborn coz well I am scared he's bigger and will start
                    bullying me. My friend makes good food in Abuja too, so If you are around the FCT, <a href="#">Patronize exotic foods</a>
                    I love technology and I derive joy in using it to profer solutions to societal problems and needs.</strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>
                    So, during NYSC 3-weeks camp I met this boring ass with bushy hair - Blessing, he was so alone. In my magnanimity I took
                    compassion on him and allowed him roll with me to polish up his social awkardness. It worked. I changed his life. I am a god.</strong>
